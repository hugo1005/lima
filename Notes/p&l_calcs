Realised - From Closed Out Positions
Unrealised - From Open Positions (Marked to Market)

Cash

Execution Costs / Slippage

Overseas Cash Items (Overseas Equities) ~ Changes in Pnl due to price and exchange rate


# -----------
PNL = REALISED PNL + UNREALISED PNL  (Fill matching using FIFO, LIFO and Averagiing methods available)

Averaging Methodology
i = 1, ..., N where we have N fills
> [1] Avg Price = sum(Qty[i] * Price[i]) / sum(Qty[i])
> Total Buy Quantity = sum(Qty[i] * Indicator[i is BUY])
> Total Sell Quantity = sum(Qty[i] * Indicator[i is SELL])
> Avg Buy Price, Avg Sell Price (As Above [1])
> REALISED PNL (Points) = (Avg Sell Price - Avg Buy Price) * min(Total Buy Quantity, Total Sell Quantity) 
> REALISED PNL (Contract Currency) = REALISED PNL (Points) * Contract Point Value Value
> Net Position (Points) = Total Buy Quantity - Total Sell Quantity
> Average Open Price = Avg Buy Price * Indicator[Net Position > 0] + Avg Sell Price * Indicator[Net Position < 0]
> UNREALISED PNL (Points) = (Theoretical Exit Price - Average Open Price) * Net Position
> UNREALISED PNL (Contract Currency) = UNREALISED PNL (Points) * Contract Point Value Value
> PNL TOTAL = REALISED PNL (Contract Currency) + UNREALISED PNL (Contract Currency)


Mark To Market Methodology

> Delta =  Change in position qty since last period = (Current Positions - New Trade Quantity)
> Gamma = Change in Price since last period = ( Current Price - Prior Period Price )

> MtM = Delta * Gamma  (CHANGE IN EXISTING POSITION SINCE PRIOR PERIOD)

> New Trades Pnl = New Trade Qty  * ( Current Price - Trade Price )                 (IMPACT OF TRADE ENTRY)

> ClosedTradesP&L = -1 * ( Closed Trade Qty * (Trade Price - Prior Period Price))    (IMPACT OF TRADE EXIT)

TPL = MtM + NewTradesP&L + ClosedTradesP&L

Intitively TPL = Mtm (Value Closing out all)


So essentially we have:
MtM = Current Positions * Change in Price since last period - New Trade Qty * Change in Price since last period
    = Change in Current Position Value - Change in New Position Value 
    = Change in Prior Period Position Value

New Trades Pnl

ClosedTradesPnL = -1 * ( Closed Trade Qty * (Trade Price - Prior Period Price))
                = -1 * ( Value of closing trade - Prior Value of Trade Amount)
                = Prior Value of Trade Amount - Value of closing the trade
